For example, if a person wants to download an app, the first way is to search on it on google try different download links and then selecting the link which is spam-free OR the second way is to open a trusted website and simply download from the link. Of course we will choose the second way, it doesn’t matter if the app is a spam or not.

Easily recognizable ‘rhythm’, eye catching designs, easy-to-understand content etc etc……all these things always work good at attracting the customers.We hate waiting for others or do boring stuff because our brain doesn’t like to be free.So, if you want to do start-ups,run your own business, publicize your own product then these things will help you a lot."
